## **About the Problem**
Tomato plants are susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly affect crop yield and quality. Early detection of these diseases can save farmers time and resources.

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, to classify images of tomato leaves into healthy or diseased categories, automating the disease detection process.
